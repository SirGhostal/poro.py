# PoroPy
An async python framework for communicating with the Riot API in python. 

Under heavy development so expect major changes in the upcomming time.

# Installation
To install Poro.py:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Zachy24/poro.py
```
You will also need a RiotGames Api key which can be acquired from [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/)

# Pipeline
    - Implement handlers to hook up your SQL database and limit the number of API Requests made.
    - Return pythonic objects instead of raw json data. More user friendly...
    - Update endpoints to v4.
